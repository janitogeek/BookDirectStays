Hi there!

I’m working on my directory website, BookDirectStays.com, and would like to make the following changes to enhance the user experience and ensure everything is aligned with my goals:

Form Field Update:

Could you please change the field name from “Booking Site URL” to “Direct Booking Site URL” in the submission form? This is to make it clearer for property managers that the site should be a direct booking link, not from OTAs like Airbnb or Booking.com.

Design Enhancements:

Visual Appeal: The grid layout looks good, but could we make the cards feel more interactive? I’d like to add hover effects that make the cards stand out when the user hovers over them.

Buttons: Can we make the “Visit Booking Site” button more prominent, perhaps by adding color to it, like a vibrant blue or green, to encourage clicks?

Image Handling: The listing images should look more consistent in size. Can we ensure all images are scaled to fit the card and have a clean appearance?

Filter Section: Let’s have a filter dropdown for visitors to select specific countries or regions, such as Paris or France. This will help them narrow down their search easily.

Responsiveness: Can we make sure the layout is fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile? It’s important that the grid adjusts nicely on smaller screens.

General UX:

Would it be possible to add some hover effects or animations to the listing cards, so they pop more when users hover over them? This will make the interface feel more engaging.

Let’s include a “No results found” message if no listings match a filter, with a suggestion to check other regions or try again later.

Airtable Integration:

We’ll be using Airtable to store the property listings. Can you make sure the form submissions are correctly linked to our Airtable base, so new listings are automatically added to the directory?

Thank you so much for your help! These changes will really make the directory stand out and create a better user experience.
