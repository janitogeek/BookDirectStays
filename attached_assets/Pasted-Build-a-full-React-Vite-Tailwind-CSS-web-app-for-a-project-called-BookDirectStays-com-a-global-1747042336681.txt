Build a full React + Vite + Tailwind CSS web app for a project called BookDirectStays.com — a global directory for short-term rental property managers that lets travelers book directly with hosts and skip OTA fees.

Homepage Requirements (/):

Add a hero section with this title: “Discover and book direct. No fees, just better stays.”

Subtitle: “Explore trusted rentals worldwide — skip the middleman.”

Below that, display a horizontal list of clickable country tags. Clicking one goes to /country-name.

Add a search bar with placeholder text: “Search among X direct booking sites…” (X = total listings)

The main directory section should display property manager cards in a grid (3 per row on desktop), each showing:

Logo or image

Name

Short description (e.g., “25 villas in Spain & Portugal”)

Countries listed

Button: “Visit Booking Site” (opens in a new tab)

Social media icons (Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram) if available

Show featured listings first (marked with featured: true)

Only show 6 cards by default, then add a “Show More” button to load 6 more each time it's clicked

Add a section titled: “Browse direct booking sites by country” with all countries listed again (grid or tag format)

Country Pages (/country):

Dynamically route using React Router to /country-name

Filter the listing cards to show only listings for that country

Same layout and “Show More” behavior as the homepage

Submission Page (/submit):

Title: “Add Your Direct Booking Site”

Two options: Free and Featured (Paid) listing

A form that collects: name, website, number of listings, country/region, description, logo, and optional social media links

Keep in Touch Section (on homepage footer):

Title: “Be the first to know when we launch”

Simple email input + submit button

Other Pages:

/faq — a simple FAQ page with questions and answers for travelers and hosts

/testimonials — page that displays reviews from guests and hosts

Use Tailwind CSS for all layout and styling.
Use React Query to fetch listings from a mock API or static JSON file (later to be replaced by Airtable).
Sort cards by featured: true first.
Include vite.config.js with base '/' and a vercel.json rewrite to support routing.

Use placeholder images and data if necessary.
